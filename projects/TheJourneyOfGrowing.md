<h2> The Overview </h2>
A senior portfolio is a project that seniors create to gather all of their best works and pieces into one place to showcase for their future. This project allows for a student to see their strengths and weaknesses in terms of what parts of their writing is good, and/or what works they might need to add for their portfolio to be better for their future. It's a form of reflection from their previous years with their favorite and most proudful works. Not only does a senior portfolio showcase a student academically, but it often reflects what kind of person the student may be. Senior portfolios, and portfolios in general, are an important aspect in an educational career because it allows for the collection and conclusion of a students work throughout school to be showcased.
For this senior portfolio, specifically, the topics that were required to include certain pieces for were:
- Title Page: Includes an image that represents me and the theme of the portfolio
- Table of Contents: Organizes the paper making it easier to navigate
- Introduction: An introduction to the theme of my portfolio and why this theme is appropriate
- 

<h2> My Lesson </h2>
This senior portfolio consists of all my favorite writing pieces that I completed in high school. Comprising of about 17 pieces ranging from Essays, Poems, Creative pieces, to Japanese writing, they all contribute to my theme of growth. This portfolio in particular represents a time where I moved from Japan to Hawaii and many of the pieces represent the changes and adjustments I went through, thus, making it very personal. 
It talks about many of my personal experiences with very personal writing, while also challenging me as a writing to be creative, professional, and authentic in my writing.

All works in the portfolio were written without thinking of the theme and they were all written at different times of my life. However, the constant theme that I came to realize while collecting these pieces was my journey of growth from moving. Being the first project with strict requirements, from components to organization to setting up, it required me to consider the order and decide what pieces are worthy of inclusion. It also allowed me to critique my writing but also admire it as it was my hard work and time.
