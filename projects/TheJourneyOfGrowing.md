summary: "A collection of my top literature pieces from high school."
---

This Senior portfolio consists of all my favorite writing pieces in High school. Comprising of about 17 pieces ranging from Essays, Poems, Creative pieces, to Japanese writing, they all contribute to a theme of growing. It's talks about many of my personal experiences with very personal writing, while also challenging me as a writing to be creative, professional, and authentic in my writing.

All works in the portfolio were written without thinking of the theme and they were all written at different times of my life. However, the constant theme that I came to realize while collecting these pieces was my journey of growth from moving. Being the first project with strict requirements, from components to organization to setting up, it required me to consider the order and decide what pieces are worthy of inclusion. It also allowed me to critique my writing but also admire it as it was my hard work and time.
