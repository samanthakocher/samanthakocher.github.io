This Senior portfolio consists of all my favorite writing pieces in High school. Consisting of about 17 pieces ranging from Essays, Poems, Creative pieces, to Japanese writing, they all contribute to a theme of growing. It's talks about many of my personal experiences with very personal writing, while also challenging me as a writing to be creative, professional, and authentic.

All works in the portfolio were written without thinking of a the theme and they were all written at different times of my life. However, the constant theme that I saw while collecting these pieces was my journey of growth from moving, thus, making it the theme. As this was the first project that had strict requirements from components to organization to setting up, it required me to think of the order and plan what pieces are worthy of including and what were not. It also allowed me to critique my writing but also admire it as it was my hard work and time.
