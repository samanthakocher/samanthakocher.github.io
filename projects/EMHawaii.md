<h2> The Overview </h2>
EM Hawaii is a local organization that offers probiotic and microbial products that can be used for a variety of reasons. I chose environmental issues as an area of interest because I think we need to help the planet become better given the impact of human activities. Since environmental issues were an interest, I chose to work with an organization that also values the environment and creates product to help naturally restore our resources.
In this project, I was tasked with working with this organization to spread awareness about their products and how they can be used for various purposes, such as cleaning your house, health and wellness, argriculture, animal, environmental, composting, cooking, and even cooking. I was connected to this organization with the help of the teacher in charge of the project. Once they agreed to work with me, I was able to come up with a plan and ideas to help bring awareness to their company and mission. 

Some things this project consisted of:
- Formal speaking
- Pitching my ideas
- Making my ideas into reality
- Presenting my progress monthly
- Presenting the final project results

<h2> My Role and Lesson </h2>
During this project, I created slides to propose my ideas of spreading the awareness to what their products do. I came up with two ideas: 1) Using social media to my advantage by creating a TikTok video to bring awareness to a cleaning product made by their microbial product; 2) Asking a science teacher at school to educate students on this product as a part of their experiments. The TikTok video was one idea because at the time, TikTok was just becoming popular and I thought, though it was a little out of reach, the product could go viral by chance allowed millions of Tiktok users to buy it. The idea of using EM products in school cam from the idea that if a teacher would teach the younger generations on how to properly take care of the environment, then maybe they will grow with that knowledge and take care of the environment too.
