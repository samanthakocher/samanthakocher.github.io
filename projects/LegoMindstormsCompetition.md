<h2> The Overview </h2>
Lego Mindstorm is a robot system created by Legos. The "brain" or machine is just a device, then we build its body from legos, it often, includes wheels, sensors, and more. It can be built with any kind of lego into any kind of robot you desire that includes wheels and sensors. This competition was a part of the Robotics club I was a part of and though we had a few games, our job for the competition itself was to set the robot up to play tag with 3 other robots. This included a camera sensor and a touch sensor. If it sensed an object in X amount of inches, it would run a program. If it touched something (i.e. the oponents, the wall/boundary, etc.), it will also run a program. Though, with the knowledge I have now, I am sure that we could've made the program and code more intricate, we had 3 programs on the brain and before each match, we would select one. Everytime the sensor sensed something, the program will trigger a few commands and execute them. In every round, the same program was repeated each time the sensor would activate it. The type of programming we used was block coding on an application that was built for the Lego Mindstorms.

Some things that we had to do were:
- Built the body around the brain of the Lego Mindstorm
- Create a few programs to execute repeatedly for each round
- Make sure that our build fit the requirements of the competition or type of game (i.e. red parts on the wheels to indicate if we are tagged or not)

<h2> My Lesson and Part </h2>
This club allowed me to experiment and discover robotics more. My favorite part of robotics, however, was the coding aspect and seeing my code in action. I also enjoyed the competition aspect of who can create a better algorithm that can outsmart the other movements. Though I had very little knowledge of computer science and coding, I still found joy in connecting all of the blocks of code together to create actions. 

This competition was in groups of about 3 to 4 people. My group had 2 other people and we worked together to decide what we wanted our robot to do. We each wrote one program (leading to 3 programs total) and helped each other think of what we want it do when needed. Since my group members were my friends, it allowed for us to comfortably assist eachother when we needed. I also liked how we could celebrate as a team because we all knew how much work went into our robot and its programs.
