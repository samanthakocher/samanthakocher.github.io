The image above is a sample image of what a Lego Mindstorm might look like. This one in particular is from https://blog.nomagic.com/collaboration-between-simulated-model-and-external-system-controlling-lego-mindstorms-with-cameo-simulation-toolkit/ and depicts a shooter bot.

Lego Mindstorm is a robot system created my Legos. The "brain" or machine is just a device, then we build it's body from legos. Often, wheels, sensors, and more are involved in the Lego constructions. Our job was to set the robot up to play tag with 3 other robots. This included a camera sensor and a touch sensor. If it sensed an object in X amount of inches, it would run a program. If it touched something (i.e. the oponents, the wall/boundary, etc.), it will also run a different program. The types of programming we used was primarily block coding on an application that was built for the Lego Mindstorm. 

Another way we used these Lego Mindstorms was to play soccer. In this case, we would adjust our robot to be able to endure the movement and possible bumping into different robots. We created a large claw in the front to "hold" the ball. Instead of block coding, we used an app that was created for Lego Mindstorms to control the robots 2 wheels.

For both of these games, we worked in teams of 3. My two friends and I worked together to plan what we want our robot to do and used the block code to execute our plans. We had about 4 different programs for a variety of what we wanted our robot to do.
