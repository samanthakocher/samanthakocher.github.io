EM Hawaii is a local organization that offers Probiotic and Microbial Products that can be used for a variety of reasons. I worked with this organization as project to spread awareness about their products and how they can be used for things like cleanig your house, health and wellness, argriculture, animal, environmental, composting, cooking, and even cooking.

During this project, I proposed my idea of spreading the awareness of what thier products do by asking a science teacher at school to educate the students on this product as a part of their experiments. By using EM products in school, I thought it would teach the younger generations on how to properly take care of the environment. 

Along with the student experiment, I also made a little tiktok video that she could post if she wanted to because tiktok was a fairly new application at the time (or at least it was just going viral).
