Coding is fun... until you have a bunch of bugs to fix... then it gets tedious and exhausting... which is no longer fun... then you meet ESLint... and ESLint tells you what's wrong, why it's wrong, and it even shows you how to fix it!

This past week of setting up, learning, and getting comfortable with IntelliJ and ESLint has felt like an effortless journey. From using Eclipse, to JSFiddle, etc., IntelliJ is the one you think is going to be just like everything else, but it isn't! IntelliJ and ESLint paired together is the perfect combination for someone who doesn't like to waste time thinking about what the error(s) means, aka, someone like me. With ESLint's capability of showing where the error is, what kind of error it is, why it's an error, and even how to fix the error is what makes it truly such a powerful and convenient tool for coding. I think these small, but important features for ESLint allows to a coder to get comfortable with the types of errors, how to solve them, and even how to prevent them in the future.

## Comfort

Personally, coding and comfort are usually two words that I don't put in the same sentence. Coding is usually long, tedious, and requires a lot of thinking, while comfort is quite the opposite. However, ESLint allows for coders of all levels learn about the endless types of errors and when/how they occur! With it's almost annoying and dramatic bright red lines, tabs popping up, and icons, it allows for there to eventually be some sort of familiarity of the error which eventually leads to someone growing comfortable with the various errors. This comfort then leads to a coder to avoid them in the future, and even if they do have a familiar error, they will know exactly how to fix it without thinking twice. 

## Auto-Fix!

ESLint's ability to fix my error with the click of a button is my absolute favorite feature. As a beginner coder, errors are my enemy. They seem so picky and complain about anything and everything, but give a broad explanation about what exactly they're upset about. Being able to click "ESLint: Fix ..." is GAME CHANGING! Not only does it save me time trying to decode the error message itself, but it allows me to continue the flow of my thoughts and processes of the program without having to stop and think of a whole new problem: the error. Although ESLint might have strict coding standards, ESLint makes it really easy to adhere to them with these features. As long as attention is paid to the errors before submitting the final program, it should be almost a given to get a green checkmark. Between the simple, straightforward error message and explanation, to the fix with a button features, it should be a given to have an error free program!

## Error-Solution Dictionary

Overall, although errors seem to have a bad reputation, I think ESLint simplifies the scary errors to simple errors WITH solutions. Not only are they usually fairly easy to solve or at least know what's wrong, but it is genuinely there to make you a better coder and know what is good practice or not. I personally tend to be on the more perfectionist side, so strict coding standards and expectations are only guidance on how to create the best program I can. It allows for little lessons on how to be a better programmer, and even how the specific programming language operates! IntelliJ and ESLint changed my view towards Javascript and coding applications because of its convenience, capabilities, and simplicity. If you were never impressed with other applications, for Javascript specifically, don't quit until you try IntelliJ and ESLint.
