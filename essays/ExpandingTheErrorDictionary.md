Coding is fun... until you have a bunch of bugs to fix... then it gets tedious and exhausting... which is no longer fun... then you meet ESLint... and ESLint tells you what's wrong, why it's wrong, and it even shows you how to fix it!

This past week of setting up, learning, and getting comfortable with IntelliJ and ESLint has felt like an effortless journey. From using Eclipse, to JSFiddle, etc., IntelliJ is the one you think is going to be just like everything else, but it isn't! The customizable capabilies, the various languages and preferences, and even the ability to download/upload plugins is what makes it truly a monster... the good one. It has so many capabilities that I've only touched the surface on, and it can be adjusted to almost any environment. So far, in this short period of time, I like IntelliJ and ESLint because of its customization and preference capabilies, ESLint's way or reporting the errors, and lasty, the time and work efficient suggestions.

## Build It Your Way

The best part of IntelliJ, so far, is that it can be set up to what seems like an endless amount of ways.
