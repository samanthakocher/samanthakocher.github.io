### I. Introduction
Everyone knows that AI is the future. It's what almost everyone and anyone will turn to with any question, regardless if they are "tech-savvy" or not. Of course, it depends on the type of AI application being used, but AI can help with problems ranging from letters, essays, math, code, and almost anything and everything that can be thought of.

In the Software Engineering world specifically, AI tools such as ChatGPT, Github Co-Pilot, etc. are especially useful for software engineers because it can be used as a baseline for code or algorithms. Although AI is not always 100% accurate, we can use our knowledge with the combination of the AI's output to create more efficient code that we may not have thought of without the AI's help, or at least not as fast.

During the ICS 314 Software Engineering class, I have personally only used ChatGPT because it seemed most accessible to me. I never felt the need to try GitHub CoPilot or any other AI Platform because to me, if ChatGPT didn't look right, then I probably could find a resource that can help me either solve my problem, or fix my question to be more clear for ChatGPT to understand what I am looking for.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
<br>
<br>
I did not use any AI in the Experience WODs because the experiences are built around the resources and lecture videos, so I should find my answers there. Plus, there were videos at the bottom of most Experience WODs that acted as an answer sheet or even guidance.


  2. In-class Practice WODs
<br>
<br>
I used AI in the In-class Practice WODs because due to the time pressure of class ending or professor giving the answer I wanted to be sure that I gave myself a fair shot and used all of my resources. 
<br> For example, I used AI in the In-class WOD called Murphy's Bar and Grill, I asked ChatGPT things such as "How can I add space between an icon and text in bootstrap" for the area on the navbar showing the possible tabs (Home, About Us, Instagram, etc.).

  3. In-class WODs
<br>
<br>
I almost always used AI in the In-class WODs because if it wasn't to assist my knowledge, it was to check if my instinct was right. Using AI in these WODs was not only beneficial to my grade because it allowed me to finish faster, but it also gave different ways I to accomplish the task at hand or even where to start. In these scenarios, ChatGPT was usually incorrect, but even giving the base structure, like the Grid System or even the Navbar system, helped save me time, which is valuable in timed WODs.
<br> An example of when ChatGPT helped me with a grid system would be the WOD called Morning Brew Home Page. In this WOD, I remember needing help for a few things: centering my navbar and moving the footer. I gave ChatGPT my navbar code and asked why it wasn't centered, then I gave ChatGPT my footer code and asked how to adjust its position to the right.

  4. Essays
<br>
<br>
In the Essays that we wrote in this class, I never put the prompt of the essay into ChatGPT but rather told ChatGPT to check my spelling or grammar in my essay. However, even when asking specifically for spelling errors (not grammar or any other), it would still give me recommendation to fix some sentences, but unless my original sentence didnʻt make any sense, I never listened because I felt like those minor "errors" were what made my essays personal and human, which I felt was enforced in class.


  5. Final project
<br>
<br>
I used AI in our final projects Home Page/Landing Page when it came to adjusting the style of it all. I was able to refer to previous assignments when it came to the basic layout, but I had a hard time to make the background image fit the screen perfectly, along with the navbar and footer. However, since ChatGPT can't import or export external sources (like my image), it was hard to get it to understand what my problem was. I eventually ended up asking "how to make the background image fit properly," which led it to give me some tips on how to adjust the CSS code to fit adjust an image size. With ChatGPTʻs tips and my knowledge from experience, I was able to play around with different patterns of the code which eventually gave me what I wanted.
