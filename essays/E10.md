*Javascript and Internet Slang*

Javascript is a type of programming language that was supposedly created over a weekend. With just a weekend, I think it is crazy how intricate and complex, yet simple and efficient it is! As my only prior experience with programming languages being primarily Java with some C and C++, Javascript gave me the impression that it is an informal version of Java. For example, when declaring a variable in Java, you have to also specify the type of variable you are trying to declare. However, in Javascript, it is not required.

## Internet Slang

As I relate Javascript to a real world application in terms of comprehension, I relate it to Gen-Z texting. Oftentimes, newer generations have created abbreviations to common phrases. For example, “LOL” means “Laugh(ing) Out Loud,” or “IDK” means “I don’t know.” This reminds me of Javascript because instead of calling a function with multiple lines when all it does is something simple, we can abbreviate it to one line of code. For example, 
```
function myFunction() {
  console.log("Hello World!")
}
```
can be abbreviated to
```
const myFunction = () => { console.log("Hello World!") };
```
using Javascript's ES6.
