When asking questions in times where help or advice is needed, it is important to adjust your question to the audience in which you are asking it to. In the Computer Science world, it is important to value one's time and energy as most of the questions are answered in free, voluntary time. Questions should also be formed in a way that intrigues the reader enough to want to help. Lastly, not only should the formation or construction of the question be well thought out, but so should the location in which the question should be asked at. Starting now, questions go from just a thought to almost a hypothesis that you have to research and try, then if the research is inconclusive, you structure and form a well thought-out question, then determine who and where it is appropriate to ask. <br>
<br>
<h2> Valuing Time </h2> <br>
Valuing your time and the reader/helper's time is the most important thing to consider when forming your question! First, you absolutely must have done your part in the Q&A by trying to answer you question. Only once you have exhausted all of your resources, you will have a good chance of getting a effective reply from someone. If you do not try to solve your own problem first, you will most likely be ridiculed as a lesson to learn that what you're asking can easily be found if you tried. In this environment, snarky remarks are informative rather than offensive because it teaches you to not waste other people's time by making them do the work for you. Thus, it is highly reccomended to do absolutely everything you can to answer your own question before asking someone else for help. <br>
<br>
The way you form not only your question, but also your subject is crucial to whether your question will be answered or not because it is almost like the first impression. You want the first impression to be good so you can be on good terms with the reader, AKA the reader will help answer your question. By creating your subject properly, you will have a greater chance to have someone review your question and consider answering it. If you don't create a proper subject title, the reader will be more likely to ignore your question. <br>
<br>
<h2> Forming Questions Effectively and Efficiently </h2> <br>
Along with a proper subject header, an appropriately formed question is required. When you brainstorm your subject header, you should also be organizing your thoughts and questions to where your question is efficient and effective to read and comprehend. Your question should include a detailed description of your environment (software, edition, etc.), your problem, solutions you've tried, and a respectful closing remark of appreciation at the minimum. The more detailed your question is, the better the reader will know what your situation and problem may be. However, if your question is too long or repetitive with a lot of unnecessary information, the reader may ignore your question because it's not easy to answer. Remember the fast that time is of value. The more time we require (for unnecessary reason), the less likely we are to receive an answer. <br>
